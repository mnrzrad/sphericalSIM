\title{Inverse Stereographic Projection}
\usage{
inv_stereo(u)
}
\arguments{
\item{u}{Vector or matrix of points in R^(q-1). If a vector, it is treated as
a single point. If a matrix, each row represents a point.}
}
\value{
Matrix of dimension n × q, where each row is a point on the unit sphere
  in R^q. Each row satisfies ||π^(-1)(u)|| = 1.
}
\description{
Maps points from Euclidean space R^(q-1) to the unit sphere S^(q-1) in R^q
using the inverse stereographic projection from the north pole.
}
\details{
The inverse stereographic projection π^(-1): R^(q-1) → S^(q-1) is defined as:
\deqn{π^(-1)(u) = \frac{1}{1 + ||u||^2} (2u_1, 2u_2, ..., 2u_{q-1}, 1 - ||u||^2)}

This maps the entire Euclidean space R^(q-1) onto the unit sphere S^(q-1),
excluding the north pole (0, 0, ..., 0, 1). The projection is from the north
pole, meaning:
\itemize{
  \item The origin u = 0 maps to the south pole (0, 0, ..., 0, -1)
  \item Points near the origin map to the southern hemisphere
  \item Points far from the origin approach the north pole
}
}
\examples{
# Single point: origin maps to south pole
inv_stereo(c(0, 0))  # Returns approximately [0, 0, -1]

# Multiple points
u_mat <- matrix(c(0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
y <- inv_stereo(u_mat)
rowSums(y^2)  # Verify all points are on unit sphere (all ~1)

# Point on circle in R^2 maps to curve on S^2
theta <- seq(0, 2*pi, length.out = 100)
u_circle <- cbind(cos(theta), sin(theta))
y_sphere <- inv_stereo(u_circle)
